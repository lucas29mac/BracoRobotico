# BracoRobotico
This Arduino sketch controls a 6-DOF robotic arm using six servo motors. Each servo corresponds to one degree of freedom, enabling the arm to perform complex movements such as positioning, rotation, and grasping. The code allows manual positioning through predefined angles or real-time control via serial communication.
